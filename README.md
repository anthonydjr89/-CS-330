Working on this project was a huge learning experience for me. By creating a 3D animation game from scratch, I picked up a lot about software design and development in a very hands-on way. Right from the start, I had to figure out what I wanted the game to do and how I wanted it to look—everything from choosing shapes and colors to deciding how they should move around. I also thought about what would make the game fun and interactive, like letting players control a paddle to hit the ball. As I got deeper into the project, I discovered how to design realistic and appealing 3D graphics. I used programming tools to draw shapes, control how they move, and handle what happens when a player interacts with them. I followed a step-by-step process: first creating a simple version of the game, then testing it, and finally adding more features as I went along. Each time I tested a new version, I found things that worked really well and things that needed fixing, which helped me improve with each iteration. One of the biggest lessons I learned is how useful it can be to start simple and build your way up when creating software. This method lets you tackle problems one at a time and add in extra details as your project grows. I can definitely use this approach in future projects—especially ones that might need clear visuals for explaining complex data or building engaging educational tools. Coding the actual game was challenging but also exciting. I had to write the logic for creating the shapes, moving the paddle, and figuring out what should happen when the ball hits different objects. This took a lot of trial and error to make sure the game felt smooth and responsive. Over time, I got much better at finding and fixing bugs, and I learned how to keep my code neat and organized so it was easier to update. Seeing how computer science can be used to make animations and interactive graphics really opened my eyes to what’s possible. This project showed me that programming isn’t just about writing lines of code—it’s about creating tools that can be both practical and fun to use. That’s especially important in areas like education, where good design can really help students understand difficult topics. All in all, this project was a great opportunity for me to learn about both the technical and creative sides of software development. The skills I’ve gained go beyond making a single game—they’re about solving problems with technology, which is what computer science is all about. I know these lessons will stick with me as I continue my education and move forward in my career.
